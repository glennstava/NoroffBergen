# Create a script called MetricConverter.py. 
# In the script, create a function called metric_converter, 
# which receives a single numeric argument. 

# The purpose of this method is to receive a value in inches and then 
# convert it to centimetres. The function should display the number 
# of inches that it received and the number of centimetres after conversion. 
# The function shouldnâ€™t return any values. 

# Demonstrate the use of the function in the main section of your script.
